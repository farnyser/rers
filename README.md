# Real Estates Rental Simulation

Simulate rental income under french law and compare tax system (nom propre, LMNP, micro foncier vs r√©el)

- `real_estates.py` is the implementation
- `simulation.ipynb` is a notebook to input parameters and visualize simulation results

### TODO

- Add coherency check (assert that initial cash injection + loan amount = initial cost)
- Support SCI IS tax system
